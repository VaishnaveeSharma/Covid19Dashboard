Afghanistan recorded its first positive case of COVID-19 in late February. A combination of political rifts, lack of testing, extremely social lifestyles, and a war-torn health care system led to Afghanistan’s failure to contain the novel coronavirus in the early stages. The country has struggled to diagnose COVID-19 cases, prevent an outbreak, and treat patients. Meanwhile, thousands of Afghans have been returning from Iran, where the pandemic has already hit especially hard. The political dispute over the 2019 presidential election continues to drain attention away from battling the coronavirus.
Albania
In an effort to control the spread of the virus, the Albanian government has imposed a series of restrictions. Among others, the authorities closed the country's educational institutions, canceled flights in and out of the country, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on citizens entering Albania from countries affected by the coronavirus, prohibited mass gatherings in public places and closed clubs, gyms, swimming pools and other entertainment venues. Albania's Technical Committee of Experts on the coronavirus situation also decided to close all bars and restaurants, and imposed curfew hours and harsh lockdown measures across the country.

Algeria
As the coronavirus began to spread in Algeria, activists from the popular movement, known as Hirak, debated whether to keep marching or whether to pivot the Hirak campaign to focus on the issue of the pandemic, the protection of the Algerian people and online campaigning. But the Hirak movement now finds itself fighting a media war with the state.
